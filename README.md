# SDCND-P1

The goals / steps of this project:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines in hough transform raw line format
* draw one unified line on each side

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline description

The pipeline started with the pre-processing step where the frames of video are read, converting image to gray scale while removing the noise. 

Next edges were detected using canny function and a mask was created with the region of interest where the lane lines are. 

After that, finding the lines after applying the masking on the edged image using hough probabilistic function. 

Regarding lines drawing, it is performed in 2 ways: First, drawing all the raw lines generated by hough transform. Second, find 2 solid continous lines one on right and the other on the left by means of finding the best fit of all points of hough-lines previously generated.

### 2. Potential shortcomings with current pipeline

1. the region of interest may differ due to different camera captures so the code may run unproprely in some videos 
2. when the brightness of frames differ edges might be false detected leading to code failure
3. curved lane-lines may not be detected by hough function

### 3. Possible improvements to pipeline

1. performing camera calibration and distortion handeling to reduce error occurrence
2. constrict the slope value of the unified lines so we do not get off range lines 
3. Brightness and curved lines problem maight be handeled with correct thresholding of the image, so, getting information about the geometrical and frequency distribution in the image may help us selecting correct threshold and region of interest
