# SDCND-P1

The goals / steps of this project:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines in hough transform raw line format
* draw one unified line on each side

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline description

The pipeline started with the pre-processing step where the frames of video are read, converting image to gray scale while removing the noise. 

Next edges were detected using canny function and a mask was created with the region of interest where the lane lines are. 

After that, finding the lines after applying the masking on the edged image using hough probabilistic function. 

Regarding lines drawing, it is performed in 2 ways: First, drawing all the raw lines generated by hough transform. Second, find 2 solid continous lines one on right and the other on the left by means of finding the best fit of all points of hough-lines previously generated.

As a refinment, horizontal lines were removed before finding the best fit in order to minimize errors and jumps in the fit line slope.

Noting that, The current pipeline works on all provided videos including the challenge, to do this the region of interest is adapted to each image size. All the fixed value spacings specified there are a result of trial and error

### 2. Potential shortcomings with current pipeline
 
1. when the brightness of frames differ edges might be false detected leading to failure, this appeared in the bright part of the challenge video
2. curved lane-lines may cause a problem due to issues in the selection accuracy of the region of interest
3. due to the forementioned shortcomings the lane line might be unstable throughout the whole video

### 3. Possible improvements to pipeline

1. performing camera calibration and distortion handeling to reduce error related to curved lines and region selection handeling
2. if a simple predictive algorithm was added to predict lines in the totally bright or unclear part this will allow even a better error handeling 
3. Also, thresholding of edges in gray image, if adapted to each frame according to a prior knowledge of the pixels distribution (ex: Histogram), it may improve line detection

### 4 . References and notes about helping codes

**This code was constructed with the help of other codes and references listed below**

[1] https://github.com/davidawad/Lane-Detection/blob/master/detection.py (used in calculating the best fit line)

[2] udacity codes provided throughout classes (used for the fundamental methods in image processing)

[3] https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.itemset.html (helped in elimination of horizontal lines)

_To be more specific: the methodology of finding slopes was adopted from one of the defined methods in reference [1] with some amendments, the preprocessing steps and houghlines methods were adopted from Udacity course provided in class._
